Moscow Time is a Bitcoin meme spawned by cybersecurity researcher Chris Vickery, during Twitter billionaire Jack Dorsey's tesimony before the Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on misinformation.

Chris Vickery started the meme with his <a href="https://twitter.com/VickerySec/status/1375128455134646279?s=20">tweet</a> asking what time zone Jack was testifying from as his "clock" said 1952. He clarified in a further  <a href="https://twitter.com/VickerySec/status/1375130578660433924?s=20">tweet</a> that the clock must be set to current Moscow time, refusing to belive otherwise.
