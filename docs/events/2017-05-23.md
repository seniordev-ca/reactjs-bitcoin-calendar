The Bitcoin Scaling Agreement, better known as the New York Agreement, proposed jointly by over 50 companies at Consensus 2017, provoked the 2017 blocksize war. The New York Agreement intended to put an end to Bitcoinâ€™s long-lasting scaling debate by increasing the block capacity through activating Segregated Witness and doubling the block size (ie SegWit2X).
