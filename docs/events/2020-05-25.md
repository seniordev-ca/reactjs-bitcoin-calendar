This day celebrates the embarrassment of Craig Steven Wright, the infamous liar and Satoshi Nakamoto impersonator (often referred to as Faketoshi). On this day in 2020, the owner of mined coins from as early as 37 days after the Genesis Block, signed a message with 145 private keys stating, "Craig Steven Wright is a liar and a fraud".
