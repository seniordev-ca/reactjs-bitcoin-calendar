To celebrate Bitcoinâ€™s 10th Birthday, Trace Mayer started an annual Proof of Keys Celebration. Participats can declare monetary sovereignty by withdrawing all BTC held with trusted 3rd parties to software they control the private keys for, like a secure hardware wallet like the coldcard. Not your keys, not your bitcoin!
