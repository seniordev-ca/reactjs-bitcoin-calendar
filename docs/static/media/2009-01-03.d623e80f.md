The Genesis Block is mined by Satoshi Nakamoto. This is the official birth of the Bitcoin Blockchain. A genesis block is the first block of a block chain. It is a special case in that it does not reference a previous block, and for Bitcoin and almost all of its derivatives, it produces an unspendable subsidy (a 50 Bitcoin block reward). The genesis block famously contains the dated title of a newspaper article in The Times: The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.
